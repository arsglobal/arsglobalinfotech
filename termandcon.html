            <h2 class="section-title">How we use your information:</h2>
            <p>
              In most cases, we collect your information on the basis of your desire to avail a particular Service from us.

We may also use your information for our business accounting and tax purposes.

We will occasionally send you product updates where we have assessed that it is beneficial to you as a customer and in our interests. Such information will be non-intrusive and is processed on the grounds of legitimate interests. On the basis of your opt-in, we will send you updates related to events, webinars, blogs and other marketing and promotional activities where we have assessed that it is beneficial to you as a customer and in our interests.
